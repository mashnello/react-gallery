One of the features that needs to be implemented is managing images with tooltips.

Admin can upload images and add special pointer to it. When user hovers this pointer, tooltip appears. Tooltip text is customizable by admin.

We need to create a tool for admin to manage images with tooltips.
Admin should be able to see list of images, add image, edit image, delete image.
Also with adding or editing images he can add or edit tooltips pointer.
Also we need to have a preview mode to test image with tooltip to see how it works for a common user.

###Requirements:###
You should use one of the modern js frameworks
It is necessary to emulate server interactions.
All responses have to be stubbed.
